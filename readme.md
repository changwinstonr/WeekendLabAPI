#Building a 'Magic: The Gathering' Card Viewing Application
###Scry API
by: Winston Chang
## Exercise

In this lab, I will be using an api to create a viewing app!

#### Objectives
- _V_ Ability to search for user entered keyword results from an api.
- _X_ API calls should be done on a separate thread. Recommended 3rd-party Library: i.e. "android-async-http'.
- _V_ Separate Class handles API calls (aren't these two < ^ the same?)
- _X_ Display user's search results.


**Bonus**:

- Material design
- Accessibility
- Display more data related to an individual search result when the search result is clicked.
- Contain at least two different calls to the api (in the case of Flickr, uses two different methods).
- Displays user related content (requires OAuth).
- Modifies the current users data via the api.

#### Deliverable

Application of above Objectives.
